% The main goal of this work is to implement both procedural terrain generation and volumetric clouds in real time using C++ and OpenGL. To make the environment explorable, the user can fly around in a airplane and through the clouds with a given objective.

% The inspiration for this project comes from Sebestian Lague's video \cite{sebestianlague2019} and this shadertoy example \cite{shadertoy2013}.

% However, contrary to above examples which are either built on top of an engine or are limited in scope, this project aims to build everything from scratch and produce an infinite explorable world using noise algorithms and let the user interact with clouds in real time while maintaining a high fps.

This thesis explores the implementation of real-time procedural terrain generation and volumetric cloud rendering using C++ and OpenGL. The goal is to create a fully explorable 3D environment in which the user can pilot an aircraft through dynamically generated landscapes and clouds, all while maintaining high rendering performance.

Procedural content generation enables infinite, non-repeating environments without the need for handcrafted assets. Volumetric clouds further enhance immersion by simulating complex atmospheric phenomena. Together, these systems form the foundation of a lightweight, yet visually rich virtual world.

The main inspirations for this work come from Sebastian Lague's development series \cite{sebestianlague2019} and community shaders such as those found on Shadertoy \cite{shadertoy2013} \cite{reinder2018}. However, unlike these examples — which either depend on high-level engines or focus on isolated effects — this project aims to build everything from scratch, including the rendering pipeline, asset management, and interaction systems.
