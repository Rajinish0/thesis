\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:sum}

This project has been a substantial undertaking, combining real-time procedural terrain generation, volumetric cloud rendering, and rigid body physics within an OpenGL framework using C++. One of the most challenging yet rewarding aspects was ensuring the system remained stable and free of memory leaks, which required careful debugging and attention to resource management.

Throughout this process, I gained valuable insights into graphics programming, performance optimization, and system architecture. The experience of integrating multiple complex systems—terrain generation, GPU-based rendering techniques, and physics simulation for the airplane—has been deeply educational and has significantly improved my engineering skills.

I could not have achieved this without the help of the open-source community and the vast number of learning resources freely available online. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the contributors of those resources, and I hope this thesis and project may, in turn, serve as a helpful reference for others working on similar topics.

Looking ahead, there are many ways to extend this work: implementing more physically accurate weather effects, refining collision detection, or enhancing terrain level-of-detail for performance. Nonetheless, this project forms a solid foundation for continued exploration in real-time simulation and rendering.
